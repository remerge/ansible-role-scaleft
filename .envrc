# shellcheck shell=bash

# Turns on shell execution strictness. This will force the .envrc
# evaluation context to exit immediately if:
#
# - any command in a pipeline returns a non-zero exit status that is
#   not otherwise handled as part of `if`, `while`, or `until` tests,
#   return value negation (`!`), or part of a boolean (`&&` or `||`)
#   chain.
# - any variable that has not explicitly been set or declared (with
#   either `declare` or `local`) is referenced.
